    A placeholder for a future, more advanced Permission Manager.
    
    This class could integrate with external authentication and authorization
    systems (e.g., OAuth, LDAP, Active Directory) to enforce fine-grained
    access control on context chunks.
    
    Example functionality could include:
    - Checking if a user has access to a specific document ID.
    - Filtering context based on data sensitivity levels (e.g., 'public', 'internal', 'confidential').
    - Verifying ownership before showing data (e.g., only show tasks assigned to the user).
